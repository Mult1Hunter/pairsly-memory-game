# Pairsly - Memory Game (WordPress plugin)

A memory (concentration) game for WordPress: your own card images, three
difficulty tiers with separate leaderboards, server-verified scores and
optional bot protection (Cloudflare Turnstile, Google reCAPTCHA v2/v3,
hCaptcha). Drop it in with a block, a shortcode, or the dedicated page the
plugin maintains for you.

- Requires WordPress 6.0+, PHP 7.4+. Tested up to WordPress 7.1.
- License: GPLv2 or later.

The user-facing description, FAQ and changelog live in [`readme.txt`](readme.txt)
(the WordPress.org format). This file is for people working on the code.

## Request flow

```
GET  /config          -> pair counts, pool stats
POST /verify          captcha token (or nothing when provider = none) -> session token
POST /start-run       session token + tier -> run token + server-picked deck
POST /finish-run      run token + moves -> server-timed score (single use)
POST /submit-score    run token + name -> stored, ranked
GET  /leaderboard     tier, limit -> entries
```

Namespace: `pairsly-memory-game/v1`. All routes are anonymous by design (players
are visitors, not WordPress users); trust comes from the signed tokens, not
WordPress auth. The POST routes additionally refuse browser requests whose
`Origin` is another site (filter `pairsmg_allowed_origins`). See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development

A local WordPress + MySQL stack is in `docker-compose.yml` (dev-only
credentials). It registers with the machine's shared traefik proxy as
`http://pairs.local` (add `127.0.0.1 pairs.local` to `/etc/hosts`);
`docker compose up -d`, then `wp core install` once via
`docker compose exec -T wpcli wp core install --url=http://pairs.local ...`.
The plugin is not bind-mounted - install it the way a user would with
`bin/deploy-local.sh`.

```
composer install          # PHPCS (WordPress + PHPCompatibility), parallel-lint, PHPUnit
composer check            # lint + phpcs + unit tests
composer test             # unit tests only (tests/, no WordPress needed - see tests/bootstrap.php)
node --check assets/js/game.js blocks/game/index.js
```

The unit tests cover the parts that must not regress silently: the score
formula, token signing / expiry / tamper / replay, deck selection (own
cards first, special quota, fallback deck), settings sanitising (per-tab
checkbox handling, secret retention, clamping) and the captcha provider
matrix. They run against a ~100-line stub of the WordPress functions the
classes use, so they take milliseconds and need no database.

Regenerate the translation template after changing strings:

```
wp i18n make-pot . languages/pairsly-memory-game.pot --exclude=vendor,node_modules,.github,bin,tests
python3 bin/build-sl_SI.py && wp i18n make-mo languages
```

The .po/.mo files are kept in the repo as the source for the Slovenian
translation but are excluded from the release zip (`.distignore`):
wp.org delivers language packs from translate.wordpress.org, and since
WordPress 4.6 those load without `load_plugin_textdomain()`, which the
plugin therefore no longer calls.

Deploy the current checkout into that local WordPress as a real plugin
install (builds the same zip the release workflow does, then
`wp plugin install --force`): `bin/deploy-local.sh`. Run it after every push
so the local site tracks `main`.

Build the release zip (respects `.distignore`):

```
mkdir -p /tmp/dist/pairsly-memory-game
rsync -a --exclude-from=.distignore ./ /tmp/dist/pairsly-memory-game/
(cd /tmp/dist && zip -r pairsly-memory-game.zip pairsly-memory-game)
```

Tagging `vX.Y.Z` runs the release workflow, which checks that the tag,
plugin header, `PAIRSMG_VERSION` and `Stable tag` agree, builds
`pairsly-memory-game-X.Y.Z.zip` (unpacking to a plain `pairsly-memory-game/`
folder, as WordPress requires) and attaches it to the GitHub release. Install
that asset - not GitHub's automatic "Source code" archives, which unpack to
`pairsly-memory-game-X.Y.Z/` and include development files.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Keep to the existing style (4-space
PSR-ish PHP, ES5 JS, no build step), escape everything on output, sanitize
everything on input, and make CI green.
